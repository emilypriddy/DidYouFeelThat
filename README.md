# DidYouFeelThat

DidYouFeelThat was an app for iOS that used PubNub and Parse services to track earthquakes at user-selected locations and alert users of the earthquakes. If the user felt an earthquake before it had been registered by USGS, the response would be logged and all responses sent to the app within a specified timeframe and location would be logged.
